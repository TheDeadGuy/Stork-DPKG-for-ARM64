# Stork-DPKG-for-ARM64

This repo is for a ISC Stork Agent package for ARM64 systems.
Built on a Raspberry Pi 4 4gb.

If you'd like to build it yourself or have arm64 compatible rake build available to you. I have a cloned repo for that here -> https://github.com/TheDeadGuy/stork/blob/master/README.md
